# Pet Shooping Web Page

> This is a Pet shopping website. The design is based on the Mohammed Awad design that you can find in the webpage Behance in this link [Design Mohammed Awad](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX). The main idea is to use CSS properties and features like Flexbox, Grid, and others to reach the same look like the reference design page above in the link. Also, I used the framework bootstrap and the preprocessor Sass in order to make faster the workflow.
